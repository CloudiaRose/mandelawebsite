        the world."
        <br />
        2. "I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph
        over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who

        3. "For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live
        in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others."

        <br />
        8. "It is better to lead from behind and to put others in front,
        especially when you celebrate victory when nice things occur. You take
        the front line when there is danger. Then people will appreciate your
        leadership."
